The sequences from SILVA 138, filtered were Fungi (Dikarya only) and protist (SAR, Amoebozoa, Excavata). total 56.691. Therefore, all data generated in the excel
shows the coverage of the candites over the pool of 56.691 sequences. I removed 16S from the data.

tip: the sequences were test using a software that is not so precise, but is fast and can do the job. If you need a more precise accuracy,
you should test the selected sequence candidate in the website : https://www.arb-silva.de/search/testprobe/

All of then are for the V4 region of the 18S
